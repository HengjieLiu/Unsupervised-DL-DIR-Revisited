Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration Revisited: Enhancing Performance through Registration-Specific Designs (submitted to MIDL 2025 short paper track)

We highlight the value of incorporating registration-specific designs—such as multi-resolution pyramids, local correlation, and inverse consistency constraints—for unsupervised deformable image registration. With these designs, simple network architectures can achieve competitive performance.
